"The Battle Spire" is a turn-based dungeon crawler game, that incorporates a card structure for combat. 

Levels are generated as you explore each room, ending with bosses and treasures. Equipment decides your combat abilities, this takes in the form of a deck of cards where a hand of 3 will be drawn at the start of a turn, 1 movement, 1 combat, 1 special/random. Combat is deadly and requires tactical thinking of positioning and direction.

Each level is structured of square rooms, that consist of hexagon tiles. Rooms have an exit on each cardinal direction, hiding other rooms. Once a door is opened there is no going back, so choose wisely.
